# ScreenAIr
Screening is a process in which HR agents look for the most promising candidates through company's database or in social media like LinkedIn. Then they try to reach and invite them for a first interview.

So our project can help in this context. Just Upload a candidates file and select your requirements and our software will automatically screen out the candidates for you.
